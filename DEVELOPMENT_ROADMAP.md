```
â€¢ Implement user accounts and authentication
â€¢ Add role-based permissions and access control
â€¢ Create user preference management
â€¢ Add multi-user session support
```

**Why Important**: Professional deployment requires user management

---

## ðŸ”§ LOW PRIORITY (WEEK 7-8)

### Nice-to-have features for comprehensive solution

#### 10. Digital Signage Implementation

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: High | **Risk**: High

```
â€¢ Build complete digital signage content management
â€¢ Implement content scheduling and rotation
â€¢ Add multi-format media support (images, videos, text)
â€¢ Create remote content update capabilities
```

**Why Later**: Complex feature set, not core to music management

#### 11. Video Output System

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: High | **Risk**: High

```
â€¢ Implement live streaming capabilities
â€¢ Add session recording functionality
â€¢ Create output quality configuration
â€¢ Add multi-platform streaming support
```

**Why Later**: Advanced feature, significant development effort

#### 12. Advanced System Features
